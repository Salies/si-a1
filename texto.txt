When purgatory's waiting the girl immaculate
The highest of commandments dictates to copulate
No grave is animated, you're buried all alone
So let her work a wonder and wake your flesh and bone
Resurrection by erection
Raise your phallus to the sky and you never die
It's resurrection by erection
Raise your bone up to the sky and you never gonna die
Hallelujah, resurrection
The funeral is calling the mortuary blow
Between my legs I'm waking, I rise from down below
Why do you think, believer, God gave you carnal lust?
So pray to get a hard on before we turn to dust
Resurrection by erection
Raise your phallus to the sky and you never die
It's resurrection by erection
When you wake up from the dead, and the angels give a head
Hallelujah, resurrection
Now I want my resurrection
Oh, I long for resurrection
All I want is resurrection now
(Resurrection!) Now!
The devil and the maiden prepare for going wild
The new messiah calling the purgatory child
Before my flesh is fading the virgin has a turn
The third of days we're climbing the point of no return
Resurrection (resurrection) by erection (by erection)
Raise your phallus to the sky and you never die
It's resurrection (resurrection) by erection (by erection)
Raise your bone up to the sky and you never gonna die
Hallelujah, resurrection
